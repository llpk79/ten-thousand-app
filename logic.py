                    Welcome to Ten Thousand
                           The Game!
Objective:
    Score 10,000 points.
    Any turn in which a player ends with more than 10,000 points will be the 
    final turn.
    If multiple players finish with more than 10,000 points, the winner is the
    player with the most points.

To score:
    1's and 5's are worth 100 and 50 points respectively.
    Three-of-a-kind is worth the die number x 100. (Three 1's is 1000 points)
    Four-of-a-kind is worth double the same Three-of-a-kind.
    Five-of-a-kind is double Four-of-a-kind.
    Six of any number is worth 5000 points.
    A six dice straight is worth 1500 points.
    Three pairs are also worth 1500 points.

To play:
    Your dice will appear in [brackets].
    Choose your dice by the reference number located above your dice.
    You must choose at least one scoring die per throw. If no scoring die are
    thrown your turn is over and your score for the turn will be zero.
    You must score at least 500 points in one turn to get on the board.
    If you get six keepers in a turn, you may choose to roll all dice again.
    You'll press Enter a lot. Sorry about that. There will be graphics soon.
    Have fun and thanks for helping me develop my first app!!
