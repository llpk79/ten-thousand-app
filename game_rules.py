Objective:
    Score the most points.
    If a player ends with 10,000 points or more, other players have one turn to beat them.
    If multiple players finish with more than 10,000 points, the winner is the player with the most points.

To score:
    1's and 5's are worth 100 and 50 points respectively.
    Three-of-a-kind is worth the die number x 100. (Three 1's is 1000 points)
    Four-of-a-kind is worth double the same Three-of-a-kind.
    Five-of-a-kind is double Four-of-a-kind.
    Six of any number is worth 5000 points.
    A six dice straight is worth 1500 points.
    Three pairs are also worth 1500 points.

To play:
    Double tap or place dice you want to keep above the line.
    You must get one scoring die on each throw or your turn is over and you lose your points for the round.
    If all of the dice you've kept are scoring dice the line will turn green.
    Roll again if you want to risk your points and try for more, or keep what you've got so far.
    You must have 500 points or more in one turn to be able to start saving them.
    Have fun and good luck!
